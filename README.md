**A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent**
*and are all related to a single topic*
~~Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences~~
***should be organized into paragraphs***.
<sub>This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.</sub>

<sup>Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of information. A paragraph could contain a series of brief examples or a single long illustration of a general point.</sup> 
> It might describe a place, character, or process; narrate a series of events; compare or contrast two or more things;
>
>> classify items into categories; or describe causes and effects.
1. Regardless of the kind of information they contain,
2. all paragraphs
3. share certain characteristics.
